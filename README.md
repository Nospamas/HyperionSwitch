## Hyperion / HyperionScreenCap switcher.

Quick program to facilitate the use of a multi-stage switch to control Hyperion and HyperionScreenCap.

The program is designed to be used with a pair of switches which push the program from Off to On to Screen-Grabbing, 
or reverse that order when pressing the off switch.
